        Milk is essentially an emulsion of fat and protein in water, along with dissolved sugar (carbohydrate),
        minerals, and vitamins. These constituents are present in the milk of all mammals, though their proportions
        differ from one species to another and within species. (See Table.) The milk of each species seems to be a
        complete food for its own young for a considerable time after birth. In the stomachs of the young, milk is
        converted to a soft curd that encloses globules of fat, enabling digestion to proceed smoothly without the
        disturbance often caused by fatty food. Lactose, or milk sugar, is broken down into simpler digestible sugars by
        the enzyme lactase, which is produced in the intestine of infants. Infants who do not produce lactase develop
        lactose intolerance, a condition in which a variety of gastrointestinal problems arise. Lactose intolerance also
        commonly develops after weaning or with advancing age, when many individuals cease producing lactase.
