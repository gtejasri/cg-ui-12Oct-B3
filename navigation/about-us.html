            dairy product, milk and any of the foods made from milk, including butter, cheese, ice cream, yogurt, and
            condensed and dried milkMilk has been used by humans since the beginning of recorded time to provide both
            fresh and storable nutritious foods. In some countries almost half the milk produced is consumed as fresh
            pasteurized whole, low-fat, or skim milk. However, most milk is manufactured into more stable dairy products
            of worldwide commerce, such as butter, cheese, dried milks, ice cream, and condensed milk.

            Cow’s milk (bovine species) is by far the principal type used throughout the world. Other animals utilized
            for their milk production include buffalo (in India, China, Egypt, and the Philippines), goats (in the
            Mediterranean countries), reindeer (in northern Europe), and sheep (in southern Europe). This section
            focuses on the processing of cow’s milk and milk products unless otherwise noted. In general, the processing
            technology described for cow’s milk can be successfully applied to milk obtained from other species.
